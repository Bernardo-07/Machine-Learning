Logistic Regression 
uses this method:
- if your observed data is binary and your features are continuos
- if you need probalistics results
- when you need a linear decision
- if you need to understand the impact of a feature

logistic x linear regression
the logistic regression use a sigmoid function
sigmoid function: função hiperbólica simétrica 1/(1+ e^(-Ot*X))

The training process:
*Initialize O (teta)
*Calculate ý = sigmoid(Ot*X) for a customer
*Compare the output ý with actual output of costumer y, and record it as error
*Calculate the error for all customers
*Go back to step 2

Change the weight -> reduce the cost
cost function:
Cost(ý, y) = (sigmoid(Ot*X) - y)²
derivate to find the minimum is difficult
then we must use gradient descent
