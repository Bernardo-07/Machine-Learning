Classification:
determines the class label for an unlabeled test case

Classification algorithms in machine learning:
- K-Nearest Neighbours?

Evaluation Metrics in Classification:
- Jaccard index
the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets, (actual y and predicted ý) vai de 0 a 1

- F1-score
confusion matrix

- Log loss
perfomance of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1
ao contráior das outras the logloss accuracy é melhor quando está mais próximo de zero.
